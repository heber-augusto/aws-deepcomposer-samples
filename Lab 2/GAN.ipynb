        "The goal of this tutorial is to train a machine learning model using a dataset of Bach compositions so that the model learns to add accompaniments to a single track input melody. In other words, if the user provides a single piano track of a song such as \"twinkle twinkle little star\", the GAN model would add three other piano tracks to make the music sound more Bach-inspired.\n",
        "\n",
        "The proposed algorithm consists of two competing networks: a generator and a critic (discriminator). A generator is a deep neural network that learns to create new synthetic data that resembles the distribution of the dataset on which it was trained. A critic is another deep neural network that is trained to differentiate between real and synthetic data. The generator and the critic are trained in alternating cycles such that the generator learns to produce more and more realistic data (Bach-like music in this use case) while the critic iteratively gets better at learning to differentiate real data (Bach music) from the synthetic ones.\n",
